## Q1 Consider two 6-sided dice that are rolled independently. What is the expected value of the sum?

E(Dice1) = $\sum_{i=1}^{6}i * 1 / 6$ = 21 / 6 = 3.5  
E(Dice2) = E(dice2)  = 3.5

E(two dices) = 3.5 + 3.5 = 7

## Q2 Now consider the case where the ûrst die is rolled normally and then the second die is set equal to the value shown on the ûrst die. What is the expected value of the sum?

E(two dices) = $\sum_{i=1}^{6}i * 2 * 1 / 6 $= 42 / 6 = 7  

## Q3 Now consider the case where the first die is rolled normally and the second die is set equal to 7 minus the value of the ûrst die. What is the expected value of the sum?

E(Dice1) = 3.5
E(Dice2) = (6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1) / 6 = 21 / 6 = 3.5

E(two dices) = 7
