The asymptotic running time of them are

$$
132464 / (68 x 68) = 28.647 \\
143640 / (70 x 70) = 29.314 \\ 
155424 / (72 x 72) = 29.981 \\
$$

Method1 yields the best result based on the asymptotic running times.

By using Strassen's method, the running time would be

$$
O(68^{log^7}) = 68^{2.807} = 139477 \\
O(70^{log^7}) = 70^{2.807} = 151302 \\
O(72^{log^7}) = 72^{2.807} = 163754
$$

V Pan's methods are all better than Strassen's method.
